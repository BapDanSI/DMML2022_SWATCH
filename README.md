## Data 
Under this file, you will find our 3 core documents: 
<br><br>
1. sample_submission.csv is the base document to submit the predictions
2. training_data.csv is the first document we are training our models on
3. unlabelled_test_data.csv is the second document we use in our program to submit our preditions
<br><br>

## Code 
Under this file, you will find all our program, from V0.0 to V1.8.4

### 1. DataProjectV0.0
This is our first iteration.
1. only 4 models (no alternativ model like requested)
2. best model is logistic regression
3. predictions submitted 11.12.22 at 3pm (with on alternativ KNN prediction, less accurate, at 3:30pm)

### 2. DataProjectV1.0
This is our second iteration
1. only 4 models (no alternativ model like requested), like the first one.
2. best model is X
3. predictions submitted 11.12.22 at 3pm (with on alternativ KNN prediction, less accurate, at 3:30pm)

### 3. DataProjectV1.5
This is our second iteration
1. only 4 models (no alternativ model like requested), like the first one.
2. best model is X

### 4. DataProjectV1.6(sw)
This is our second iteration
1. only 4 models (no alternativ model like requested), like the first one.

2. best model is X
3. predictions submitted 11.12.22 at 3pm (with on alternativ KNN prediction, less accurate, at 3:30pm)

### 5. DataProjectV1.8.3
This is our second iteration
1. only 4 models (no alternativ model like requested), like the first one.
2. best model is X

## Approach to the project
Before getting more creative, we followed the course 9 and 10 on Text Analysis. 
To get a little bit of background on our group, Ahmed and myself are totally novice in coding. 
I personnaly have some basics in python due to the fact that the MScIS is my second master, the first one being the MScF from HEC Lausanne. 
We have both a very generic approach to coding. At first, copy-pasting what we have seen in class, before understanding what changes change what. 
We both are fanatics of the "learning by doing" methods. 

## Summary of the results 
Under this section, you will find the tables resuming our results from all iterations: 

### 1. DataProjectV0.0


### 2. DataProjectV1.0


### 3. DataProjectV1.5


### 4. DataProjectV1.6(sw)


### 5. DataProjectV1.7(sw-dc)


### 6. DataProjectV1.8.1


### 7. DataProjectV1.8.2


### 8. DataProjectV1.8.3


### 9. DataProjectV1.8.4
